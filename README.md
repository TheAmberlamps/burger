# Burger Time
A "burger logger" handlebars project for my Bootcamp. Created using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and deployed to Heroku.

Users are able to create new burgers and enter them into the database, which is sorted by "eaten" and "uneaten" burgers. Users can also "eat" uneaten burgers, changing their status to "eaten".

Not the most practical of websites but it did make for a few interesting challenges, such as writing an ORM to handle the database and wrapping my head around Handlebars, which helped to understand React later on.
